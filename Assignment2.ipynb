    "For Assignment 2, you will perform a short pilot study that identifies a cultural pattern related to your final project . Your submission should be in a Jupyter notebook format and address the following questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. (1 Point) Construct a final project research question related to the interpretation of a cultural pattern that interests you (i.e. \"Why is #ThrowbackThursday employed in a different way by Group A than it is by Group B?\").\n",
    "\n",
    "2. (2 Points) What digital data could you use to study this phenomenon and answer your research question? How could you collect this data? Consult the Final Project Assignment Page for several data search tools and feel free to talk with your instructor or TA if you have any further questions about how you might find and collect data related to your research question.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. (3 Points) Download this data on your computer (if you are web-scraping, or have an exceptionally challenging data source to gather from and analyze, you may choose to download only a subset of the data for the purposes of this assignment) and load it into your Python Jupyter notebook. Print out a small sample of your data in your Jupyter notebook (i.e. using the .head() command, if you're using Pandas).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. (6 Points) Using your data, empirically demonstrate in Python that the cultural phenomenon you are studying consists of replicas from a common legisign, with the same interpretants and sign relations.\n",
    "Make at least 1 plot to aid in your demonstration.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Provide a 300+ word description explaining why your Python code and plot successfully demonstrate that the cultural phenomenon you are studying consists of replicas from a common legisign.\n",
    "(3 Points) What are your next steps beyond this basic identification of a cultural pattern? Do you need to gather any additional information? Do you need to perform any additional analyses in order to successfully answer your research question? How will these additional sources and/or analyses enable you to answer your research question? Provide a 200+ word response to these questions."
